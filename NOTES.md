key data strcture of process context

+ process table - tracks information per process, in particular information that allows a pre-empted process to restart later
+ page table - translate virtual into physical addresses. Each process has its own, which effectively partitions virtual address space among processes.
+ file table - tracks , per process, files that a process has opened.

Process level context switch
Thread  level context switch

> Nginx and Unicorn  communicate via local socket

Multithreading overview

+ A process consists of one or more threads of execution
+ A thread-level context switch has a near-zero cost for threads in the same process
+ A process-level contest switch is significently more expensive, in the multithread range.

The chief disadvantage is that threads in the same process share the same address space:

+ the programmer, rather then the OS, must ensure that two threads in the same process don't inaprpropriately access the same memory location(i.e, by trying to update the location)
+ The programmer must coordinate threads in the same process to avoid 'race conditions', 
  + if the coordination is overdone, 'deadlock' may result.
+ Thread coordination must be just right
  + Too little brings the threat of race condition that happend to share an address space, results
  + too much hurts efficiency and may result in deadlock

Some system(e.g, Linux_implement standard threads as processes that happen to share an address space; other system(e.g, windows) have distinct kernel-level support for threads

  under any implementation, the standard behavior is that distinct processes have distinct address spaces, whereas threads in thes same process share an address space.

Various locking mechanisms:

+ A "semphore" restricts the number of threads allowed to access a shared resource(e.g, a shared function), For example, "semaphore"  might allow two threads to access a chunk of code simultaneously, but no more than two, A semaphore is thus a set of permission tickets, which enable a thread to access a resource.

Semaphores as 'tickets' : a semaphore is like a ticket that grants access to a resource.
a semaphore  with a value of three would grant access to three threads at most at a time.

+ A 'mutex' is a semaphore with a value of 1: whichever thread holds the mutex has access to the protected resource, whereas all others are excluded.

+ A 'monitor'(which the Java 'symchronized' block provdes) is a mechanism that enforces mutual exclusion. supports progress, and has addition mechanisms for thread cooperation: in java's case, the 'wait' mechanism supports quiet waiting for a lock to be released, and the 'notify' mechanism notifies waiters that a lock has been released.


native versus green thread, and the Global interpreter lock(GIL)

+ A 'native thread' is under kernel OS control when it comes to scheduling.
  + since roughly 2000, Java Thread instances map to 'native' thread (Same for C#)   
  + C's 'pthreads' (the 'p' for POSIX API standardization) are 'native' threads
+ A 'green thread' (aka 'microthread', 'tasklet') is under a particular langeuage's runtime control
  + In effect, 'green thread' emulate native thread, and may provide better performance for operations such as thread creation and synchronization
  + Prior to version 1.9, for example, Ruby's standard implementtaion(CRuby) had only green threads
  + A GIL is a mechanism(in implementation, a mutex) that a runtime uses to allow only one thread to execute at a time, even in a multithread environment: no thread-level parallelism
  + the standard implementation of Ruby(CRuby) and Python(CPython) have a GIL.
